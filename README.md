### About me

- I'm currently working on my portfolio (Data/Cloud/DevOps/ML Projects)
- I'm focusing on learning the modern data stack, cloud infrastructures, data processing, DevOps, and machine learning systems. (I know it's a lot, but they are all connected and complement each other.)
- I'm organizing my projects and migrating them here on GitHub.
- Fun fact: I love Canada, Technology, and learning.
