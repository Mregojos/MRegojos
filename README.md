## About me 
✨ Hi, there. 👋

✨ My name is Matt. I am a Cloud Technology Enthusiast ☁️🧑‍💻.

✨ I have a degree in Electronics Engineerin. Currently, I am fully focused on Technology. 

✨ I am currently working on my portfolio, organizing and migrating them to GitHub.

✨ My interests and focus areas are learning and building Cloud Infrastructure, Data Pipelines, CI/CD pipelines, and Machine Learning Systems.

✨ I love learning different things and want to learn more about the world and the universe and beyond. My MBTI is INTP.

✨ Fun fact: I love Canada 🍁, technology, and learning.

✨ My happy places: Being with my family, learning almost everything, watching my favorite shows like FRIENDS, One Piece, Detective Conan, and watching walking and driving tours around Canada and the world.
