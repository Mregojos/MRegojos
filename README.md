### About me 😄

✨ I am currently working on my portfolio, organizing and migrating them to GitHub.
✨ My interests and focus areas are learning and building modern data stacks, cloud infrastructure, data processing, CI/CD pipelines, and machine learning systems.
✨ Fun fact: I love Canada, technology, and learning.
