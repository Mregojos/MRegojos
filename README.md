## About me ðŸ˜„
âœ¨ My name is Matt and I am an engineer. I graduated with a degree in Electronics Engineering and now I am fully focused on Technology. I love learning different things and want to learn more about the world and the universe and beyond. My MBTI is INTP.

âœ¨ I am currently working on my portfolio, organizing and migrating them to GitHub.

âœ¨ My interests and focus areas are learning and building modern data stacks, cloud infrastructure, data processing, CI/CD pipelines, machine learning systems, and security protection.
